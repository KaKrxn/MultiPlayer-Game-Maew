## Scopes (customize per project)

`player` · `inventory` · `enemy` · `ui` · `audio` · `scene` · `build` · `docs` · `{your-system}`

> Replace with your project's actual system names. See `RULES_AND_POLICY.md` §2 for naming conventions.

## Examples

```
feat(enemy): implement shadow phase before chase

The enemy now follows silently for 3-5 seconds with audio cues
before entering chase mode, matching the GDD design intent.

Ref: GDD @tag:enemies
```

```
fix(flashlight): prevent drain while paused

Flashlight was losing battery during pause menu.
This broke the tension loop by punishing menu usage.
```

```
juice(player): add heartbeat audio on low health

- 3 intensity levels based on health percentage
- BPM increases: 60 → 90 → 120
- Fades in/out smoothly
```

## Branch Naming

- Format: `{prefix}/{short-description}`
- Examples: `feat/parry-system`, `fix/inventory-overflow`, `refactor/scene-loading`
- Use kebab-case for the description

## Quick Rule

> Before committing, check your DevLog entry in `Docs/DevLog/`.
> The commit message should be a condensed version of what you wrote there.
